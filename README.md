## Clothing-Executive-Dashboard
<br>
An excel file with two sheets: Orders, SalesPerson, and a third sheet: Products that was created for this specific task. 

<br>

### Tasks

<br>

Gather sales person data with XLOOKUP, and insert it into the orders sheet.<br>
=XLOOKUP([@EmployeeKey],Table_Salesperson[[#All],[EmployeeKey]],Table_Salesperson[[#All],[Salesperson]],,0)
<br>
Gather the Products data with INDEX and MATCH, and insert it into the orders sheet.<br>
=INDEX(Products!$A$2:$G$335,MATCH(Sales!$C2,Products!$A$1:$A$335,0),MATCH(Sales!I$1,Products!$A$1:$G$1,0))
<br>
Note: When getting email there are some empty values in order to get an empty space instead of a 0 I tweak the formula to include a conditional IF.<br>
Note: First match look column Sales!$C2, Second match look row  Sales!I$1. So when drag down or right, it doesnâ€™t populate with the last row or column, respectively.<br>
Note: Sorting mess up with formulas.<br>
