An excel file with two sheets: Sales, SalesPerson, and a third sheet: Products, that was created for this specific task. 

<br>

### Tasks

1.- Gathering data to create the sales table.
<br>

Gather sales person data with XLOOKUP, and insert it into the sales sheet.<br>
  
    =XLOOKUP([@EmployeeKey],Table_Salesperson[[#All],[EmployeeKey]],Table_Salesperson[[#All],[Salesperson]],,0)

<br>

Gather the Products data with INDEX and MATCH, and insert it into the sales sheet.<br>

    =INDEX(Products!$A$2:$G$335,MATCH(Sales!$C2,Products!$A$1:$A$335,0),MATCH(Sales!I$1,Products!$A$1:$G$1,0))

<br>

Note: When getting email there are some empty values in order to get an empty space instead of a 0 I tweak the formula to include a conditional IF.<br>
Note: First match look column Sales!$C2, Second match look row  Sales!I$1. So when drag down or right, it doesnâ€™t populate with the last row or column, respectively.<br>
Note: Sorting mess up with formulas.<br>

<br>

2.- Removed unimportant columns for these task: resellers key and sales territory key columns.

<br>

3.- Create Sales column.<br>
4.- Create Net Revenue column. (sales - cost)<br>

6.- Change data type to currency type where appropiate.<br>

<br>
